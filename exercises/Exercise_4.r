# Exercise 4
#
# Time: 10 minutes

# Answer the following questions about the iris dataset. If the :

# 1) Who collected this data and when was it collected?



# 2) What type of data structure is iris?



# 3) Take a look at the structure of iris. How many variables are there? What type are they?



# 4) The command used to answer the previous question returns the number of observations and
#    the number of variables, which effectively tells you the dimensions of the data set.
#    There is another function in R that will explicitly return the dimensions of an object.
#    See if you can find it and run it on iris.
#    HINT: Use line completion in the console window.



# 5) What is the mean petal length across all species of iris?



# 6) Create a new data frame containing only the first five rows of the iris dataset.
