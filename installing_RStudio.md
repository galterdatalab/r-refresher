# Step 1: Download and install R

2.  Pick the appropriate version for your computer:
    * **PC**: Pick the base version.
    * **Linux**: Choose the correct distribution and follow the instructions.
    * **Macs**:

      * `R-4.0.3.pkg` (macOS 10.13 (High Sierra) and higher)
      * `R-3.6.3.nn.pkg` (OS X 10.11 (El Capitan) and higher)
      * `R-3.3.3.pkg` (OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) and higher)
      * `R-3.2.1-snowleopard.pkg` (OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) - 10.8 (Mountain Lion))

        Make sure to read the notes on the install page:

        > R 4.0.3 binary for macOS 10.13 (High Sierra) and higher, signed and notarized package. Contains R 4.0.3 framework, R.app GUI 1.73 in 64-bit for Intel Macs, Tcl/Tk 8.6.6 X11 libraries and Texinfo 6.7. The latter two components are optional and can be ommitted when choosing "custom install", they are only needed if you want to use the tcltk R package or build package documentation from sources.
        >
        > Note: the use of X11 (including tcltk) requires XQuartz to be installed since it is no longer part of OS X. Always re-install XQuartz when upgrading your macOS to a new major version.
        >
        > Important: this release uses Xcode 10.1 and GNU Fortran 8.2. If you wish to compile R packages from sources, you will need to download and GNU Fortran 8.2 - see the tools directory.
