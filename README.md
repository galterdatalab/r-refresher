# R Refresher

This tutorial is design for R users who have stepped away from the platform for a while and now want to get back to it. In this workshop you will learn how to:

* Import and manipulate data
* Create basic plots
* Write an R script
* Aggregate and summarize data
* Import and use packages
* Read documentation and get more help

We will use an R Markdown document to go through examples from the topics above.

## Prerequisites

1. You should have used R at least once in the past.
2. Those completely new to R should consider taking the free [Introduction to R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r) course prior to this workshop, or take the [R: Introduction](https://sites.northwestern.edu/summerworkshops/workshop-schedule/#intror) course instead.
3. If you haven't already, you will need to download and install R and R Studio (see below).
